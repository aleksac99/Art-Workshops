# Art-Workshops
Full-Stack Web Application created for my subject for advertising and applying to art workshops.

This project demonstrates the knowledge I gained on this course and my ability to work on both client and server side of the application. To beautify client side Bootstrap was used. Server-side code was written in MVC pattern without any PHP frameworks.

# Functionality
This application demonstrates the following functionalities:
- Guest can view published workshops, filter them by name and sort them by name, date or rating. To view workshop details, user must log in.
- User can register to the platform. Upon registration request, it must be approved by admininstrator to enable User functionalities.
- User can view workshop details. He can apply to the workshop if there's room left. He can like and comment on workshops he previously attended.
- User can become organiser by submiting his first workshop suggestion. After administrator approval, he becomes organiser and his workshop becomes visible to other users.
- Organiser can submit workshop suggestions. If workshop name has already been approved by admin, new workshop doesn't require approval.
- Organiser can accept and decline attendance requests from users. He can edit or delete the workshop after publishing it.
- Administrator can manually add users and edit all submited workshops. He can accept or decline registration and promotion requests.
